# PSM-WMA Documentation Index

This repository intentionally keeps historical design, Gate and review material. Use the layers below instead of browsing all files alphabetically.

## 1. Current truth — read these first

- `../README.md` — project overview and entrypoints
- `../PROJECT_STATUS.md` — current SHA, readiness and validated metrics
- `current/architecture.md` — current system architecture
- `current/local_memory.md` — canonical Local Memory / TTT semantics
- `current/training.md` — train and resume workflow
- `current/evaluation.md` — LIBERO evaluation workflow
- `current/experiments.md` — current experiment matrix and evidence

## 2. Canonical design authority

- `build/PSM-WMA_00_project_proposal_v1.4_frozen.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_01_technical_survey_v1.7_frozen.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_02_detailed_design_v2.1_frozen.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_Local_Memory_detailed_design_addendum_v0.3.5.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_Local_Memory_canonical_training_runtime_contract_v0.3.9.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_Local_Memory_v0.3.5_active_route_member_shape_refreeze_design_v0.3.md`
- `build/PSM-WMA_Local_Memory_A2_delivery_runbook_2026-09-18.md`
## 3. Historical engineering record

`build/` also contains superseded versions, implementation designs, source audits, remediation plans and Gate runbooks. They are retained for provenance. A newer frozen/refrozen document or an explicit durable decision in `../MEMORY/DECISIONS.md` supersedes older conflicting text.

`collab/` contains agent inboxes, independent reviews, feedback and archives. It is useful for reconstructing why a decision was made, but it is **not** the recommended way to learn the current architecture.

## 4. Machine-readable evidence

- `../artifacts/CANONICAL.json` — authoritative pointers
- `../artifacts/g0/sync_a2_final_verification_2a9df880_v3.json` — engineering verifier
- `../artifacts/g0/a2_long_run_readiness_2a9df880/a2_long_run_readiness_v1.json` — long-run readiness verifier

## 5. Internal ledgers

- `../TODO.md` — current task queue
- `../SESSION.md` — execution / handoff ledger
- `../MEMORY/DECISIONS.md` — durable engineering decisions
- `../AGENTS.md` — agent collaboration and execution governance
